Async Functions
The async keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function. An async function:
=> Always returns a Promise.
=> Allows the use of the await keyword inside its body.
=> Can be used anywhere a normal function can be used.

Await Keyword
The await keyword is used inside an async function to pause the execution of the function until a Promise is resolved or rejected.

=> It can only be used inside an async function or at the top level of a module. 
=> It waits for the Promise to settle (resolve or reject). 
=> When a promise is resolved, await returns the resolved value.
=> If a promise is rejected, await throws an error that can be caught with a try/catch block.

Promise: an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

A Promise can be in one of three states:
=>Pending: The initial state, indicating that the asynchronous operation is still in progress.
=>Fulfilled (Resolved): The operation completed successfully, and the Promise holds the resulting value.
=>Rejected: The operation failed, and the Promise holds an error object.

Promises provide methods for handling these outcomes:
.then(onFulfilled, onRejected): Attaches callbacks to be executed when the Promise is either fulfilled or rejected.
.catch(onRejected): A shorthand for .then(null, onRejected), specifically for handling rejections.
.finally(onFinally): Attaches a callback that will be executed regardless of whether the Promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Key concepts:
=>Chaining: Promises can be chained together using .then() to create a sequence of asynchronous operations.
=>Error Handling: Rejections are propagated down the chain, allowing for centralized error handling using .catch().
=>async/await: A more modern syntax built on top of Promises, making asynchronous code appear more synchronous and easier to read.

Promises provide a structured way to manage asynchronous code, improving code readability and maintainability.
